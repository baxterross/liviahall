							I am here to help you feel better and regain health.
							When you are faced with a health challenge it is difficult to find a true
							ally in our impersonal, mainstream healthcare system. Diagnostic
							tests, prescription drugs that address only symptoms, and doctors
							who have lost the knowledge of commonsense healing strategies
							yield unsatisfying results.
						</p>
						<p>
							My holistic practice offers you an effective alternative.
							Addressing your health issues becomes a positive, relaxing and
							enjoyable experience, as it should be, which helps to promote true
							healing.
						</p>

							<em>
								I look forward to helping you achieve healthy results!

						<h2>About Livia's Practice</h2>
					</div>
					<div class="col-sm-8">
						<p>
							Livia’s healing skills stem from 17 years of experience
							helping her patients achieve health. She incorporates her
							knowledge of nutrition, herbology, exercise physiology,
							qigong and traditional healing modalities to create multi
							modal healing plans to tackle long standing, complicated
							conditions.
						</p>
						<p>
							Livia’s experience has taught her that when
							people develop illness there is rarely just one, but rather
							many factors, that come into the creation of the disease.
							Therefore in order to regain long lasting health one must
							also treat the illness with more than one modality.
						</p>
						<p>
							Livia’s in
							depth knowledge of many health modalities enhances her
							nurturing treatments to help you optimize your physical and
							emotional well being.
						</p>
						<p>
							Livia has successfully treated complex, chronic conditions.
							Acupuncture can help when your other doctors cannot.
							Patients have seen positive outcomes for a wide range of conditions.
